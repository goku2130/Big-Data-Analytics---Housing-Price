# Big-Data-Analytics---Housing-Price
This project with data from Kaggle, provides us an excellent chance to discover the insight of house pricing and allows us to put into practice what we have learned from the Big Data Analytics class. Based on historical sales data of the housing market of the city of Ames in Iowa, we are going to predict the price for other houses in the same city which were sold in the same period of time. The dataset used here was released a few years ago on Kaggle and some contributors have already shared their results. We plan on having an independent approach and then compare our results to existing ones.
